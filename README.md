# MetaEd-Contrib

Ed-Fi licensees can download, mix, and match these community-contributed MetaEd models for extending their ODS/API implementations. For more information on MetaEd:

## Usage Guidelines

This repository provides a mechanism for community members to share their MetaEd project files with one other. Simply copy the shared project to the Extensions folder in your fork of the `Ed-Fi-Ods-Implementation` repository (alongside the Grand Bend sample). Now you can begin working with it as you would work with your own custom MetaEd project. If you make changes, you should commit them to your `Ed-Fi-Ods-Implementation` repository only - do not copy back to this `MetaEd-Contrib` repository.
